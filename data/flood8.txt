Vietnam Railways has stationed a 450-ton freight train loaded with rocks on the Gia Vien Bridge in Hue to keep it from being swept away by the floodwaters of the Huong River.
According to the Binh Tri Thien Railway Company, floodwater on the evening of Oct. 27 rose high enough to submerge the bridge's bottom beams by about 10 cm, with strong waves striking the pillars and threatening its safety. Around 8:30 p.m., a freight train loaded with about 300 cubic meters of rocks, normally reserved for storm response, was sent to the bridge to reinforce its weight and stability.

Railway workers have been stationed around the clock to monitor both the structure and the river's changing water levels. By the morning of Oct. 28, the flood had begun to recede, with water levels falling 40 cm from the night before, leaving about 30 cm between the river and the bridge beams. Despite the improvement, waves continued to pound the pillars, so the train remains positioned on the bridge as a safety measure.

Earlier, at 6 p.m. the same day, another 19-car train carrying nearly 700 tons of rocks from Dong Hoi, Quang Tri Province, roughly 150 km away, was sent to reinforce the nearby Bach Ho Bridge.

Both the Bach Ho and Gia Vien bridges, built by the French in 1908, form part of Vietnam's North–South railway line crossing the Huong River. The northern section, Bach Ho, stretches more than 300 meters, while the southern Gia Vien section spans 102 meters. The two are connected by the Da Vien islet. Each bridge also has a narrow lane for two-wheelers. Damaged heavily during wartime, they were later restored and remain vital links for central Vietnam's transport network.

As of Oct. 28, train service through Hue remains disrupted, with water still covering about 40 cm of track at Van Xa Station. Passengers traveling between Dong Ha (Quang Tri) and Huong Thuy (Hue) have been transferred by bus for trains SE2, SE4, SE5 and SE7, while two additional train pairs, SE7/SE8, were canceled.

Hue has been the epicenter of the ongoing floods, with 32 out of its 40 communes and wards submerged. Heavy rain has pounded central Vietnam since Oct. 23 due to a mix of cold air, tropical convergence and easterly winds.

From the night of Oct. 24 to the morning of Oct. 28, rainfall in Hue reached 500–700 mm, with some locations recording over 1,000 mm, including Bach Ma Peak (2,785 mm), Khe Tre (1,484 mm), and Huong Son (1,270 mm).
