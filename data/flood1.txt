Heavy rainfall has triggered widespread landslides and flash floods across central Da Nang City, destroying 28 houses in the mountainous regions and submerging over 65,000 homes in the plains and coastal areas under 0.5-2 meters of water.
Between Oct. 24 and 28, Da Nang received a substantial volume of rainfall, with totals ranging from 500-700 mm. Certain areas saw around 900 mm rainfall over the period, driven by cold air, tropical convergence zones, and easterly winds.

This relentless downpour saturated the ground, leading to multiple landslides and flash floods.

Tra Tan Commune was hit hardest, with 30 landslide points and many roads completely cut off. On Monday night, flash floods swept away all 11 houses in the mountainous commune.
Residents in the area had been evacuated in advance, and there were no casualties, according to Nguyen Hong Lai, Secretary of the Commune Party Committee.

Ten houses across the communes of Tra Leng, Tra Doc, and Tra Giap were also swept away by landslides.

In Tra Doc Commune, around 3:50 p.m. on Tuesday, a 42-year-old man operating an excavator to clear a landslide on Dong Truong Son Road was caught when a hillside unexpectedly collapsed, sending both him and the vehicle into a ravine.

Buried under rocks and soil, he was fortunately wedged at the edge. Rescue teams responded swiftly, saving him just in time. He sustained injuries to his arms, legs, and neck. Local authorities have temporarily cordoned off the area to prevent further incidents.
Landslides also buried ten other houses in Song Y and Ngoc Tu hamlets, where all residents had been evacuated. On Tuesday afternoon, a massive landslide on a hill near National Route 40B in Tra Tan collapsed onto the road, dragging trees and floodwaters.

Road users noticed the danger and stopped in time, preventing injuries. Authorities have set up warning signs and are working to clear the debris.
The heavy rainfall, coupled with the discharge of water from hydropower plants, has led to flooding across 16 communes and wards in Da Nang, affecting over 65,000 households.

The flooding is most severe in the downstream areas of the Vu Gia - Thu Bon River system, the largest in central Vietnam that flows through Da Nang.

In Dai Loc Commune, 15,000 households are submerged under 1.5-2 meters of water. Nam Phuoc Commune is also heavily affected, with 14,150 households facing floodwaters of 0.5-1.5 meters.

Nong Son Commune is experiencing the deepest flooding, with water levels reaching up to 4 meters along the Thu Bon River, inundating 1,340 homes.

The floodwaters in the upper reaches of the Vu Gia - Thu Bon rivers began to recede on Tuesday, but downstream areas continue to see rising water levels.
Hoi An ancient town has been severely flooded, with more than 80% of the area submerged. Floodwaters rose by an additional meter on Oct. 28, submerging the iconic Pagoda Bridge and several pedestrian streets.
The town has reported at least one casualty from the flooding as a man drowned while heading to his farm.

More than 270 hectares of rice fields, crops, and aquaculture areas in Hoi An have been damaged, while transportation infrastructure has suffered significant destruction, including 1,880 meters of damaged roads, landslides, and over 32,800 cubic meters of soil and rocks washed away. The local coastline has been eroded by 3,450 meters, with erosion reaching 25-30 meters inland.

From the evening of Oct. 28 through Oct. 29, continued heavy rainfall is expected, with plains in Da Nang receiving between 150-300 mm, and some areas possibly seeing over 350 mm. Mountainous regions may receive 200-300 mm, with some places exceeding 450 mm. The rain is expected to gradually decrease from Oct. 30, with daily rainfall forecast at 20-50 mm.
