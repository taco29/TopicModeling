Vietnam and Bulgaria have issued a joint declaration on the establishment of a strategic partnership between the two countries, on the occasion of the official visit to the European country from Oct. 22 to 24 by Party General Secretary To Lam.

Since the establishment of diplomatic relation in 1950, Vietnam and Bulgaria have fostered a traditional friendship and multifaceted cooperation based on mutual trust, equality and respect, for the benefit of the peoples of both nations.
