By 3 p.m. on Oct. 27, heavy rainfall has caused the floodwaters in Hoi An to rise rapidly. The pillars of An Hoi Bridge in the middle of the Hoai River were the only visible parts.

Bach Dang Street and Nguyen Phuc Chu Street, running along the river, were flooded to nearly 2 meters.

Travel across the Hoai River was only possible by boat.

The area around the Japanese Pagoda Bridge, a symbol of Hoi An, at the intersection of Bach Dang and Tran Phu Streets remained above the floodwaters, becoming the docking point for boats dropping off tourists.

At 5 p.m., the water level was about 0.5 meters from the edge of the Japanese Pagoda Bridge, with the heavy rain showing no signs of stopping.

Nguyen Phuc Chu Street was flooded to nearly 2 meters, forcing foreign tourists staying at hotels and homestays to evacuate by boat to higher ground.

Some were concerned about crossing the Hoai River, but local authorities and traffic police were stationed at the drop-off point to assist and support tourists.

Floodwaters overflew onto Phan Chu Trinh and Hai Ba Trung streets, about 500 meters from the Hoai River, causing flooding up to 0.5 meters deep.

Traffic police were on duty, warning people to avoid areas with deep water and assisting in evacuating the elderly and children to dry ground.

Some tourists chose to travel by boat from their hotels in the flooded area, navigating up the Hoai River to buy food and experience the unique sight of traveling through the flooded streets.

The water level on Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, along the Hoai River, is about one meter high.

Boats carry people evacuated from Nguyen Phuc Chu, Nguyen Phuc Nguyen, Nguyen Phuc Tan, and Ngo Quyen streets.

This residential area, located on a sandbank between the Hoai River and Thu Bon River, is often heavily flooded when floodwaters flow downstream.

Boats carrying evacuees run along the route past the Nguyen Hoang Night Market.

Some foreign tourists continue to stroll along streets that have not yet been submerged by floodwaters.
