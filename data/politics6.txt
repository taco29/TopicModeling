The 15th National Assembly convened its 10th and last session in Hanoi on Monday, reviewing the tenure and laying the groundwork for the upcoming 16th NA.

The session will last for 40 days, closing on Dec. 11.

At this session, the NA focuses on promptly institutionalizing new policies and conclusions of the Party Central Committee, the Politburo, and the Secretariat, especially key orientations adopted at the 13th Party Central Committee’s 13th meeting, aiming to turn institutional reform into a competitive advantage and motivation for national development.

As scheduled, the NA will review and decide on 66 contents and groups of issues.

In terms of legislation, the legislative body will consider and approve 49 laws and four resolutions — the largest legislative workload since the beginning of the 15th tenure.

NA deputies will also deliberate on 13 groups of issues related to socio-economic development, State budget, supervision, and other important matters.
