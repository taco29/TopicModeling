Indonesian Minister of Higher Education, Science, and Technology Brian Yuliarto has invited all lecturers in Indonesia to collaborate in improving the quality of higher education.

He said that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto earlier requested that someone must win a Nobel Prize in the next 20–30 years and be ranked among the world’s top 100 scientists.

The President previously instructed the minister to enhance human resources in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). He also asked the ministry to push the University of Indonesia (UI) into the ranks of the world’s top 100 universities.

Speaking at the launch of the Priority Research Programme for the 2026 fiscal year, Yuliarto stressed that strong cooperation among academics must be strengthened to achieve this target.

UI’s position in the top 200 of the QS university rankings would serve as a driver for other universities, such as the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), Gadjah Mada University (UGM), and the Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology (ITS), to increase their global competitiveness.

The Indonesian Government has set a goal of achieving "Golden Indonesia" status by 2045, with the development of high-quality human resources through higher education identified as one of its main pillars.
