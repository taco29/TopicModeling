China’s CR450 bullet train has broken the world speed record for a single train, reaching 450 kph (281 mph) during pre-service trials on the Shanghai-Chongqing-Chengdu high-speed railway line on Tuesday.

This achievement surpasses the previous record of 350 kph (217 mph) held by the CR400 Fuxing trains, Interesting Engineering reported.

Other high-speed trains like France’s TGV and Japan’s Shinkansen follow with maximum speeds of 320 kph, while Korea’s KTX-Sancheon reaches 305 kph, according to Chosun Biz .

Unveiled in November 2024, the CR450 has undergone extensive testing to meet all performance targets. It is now set to undergo 600,000 kilometers of operation before it can be cleared for commercial passenger service, according to CGTN .

The CR450 can accelerate from a standstill to 350 kph in just 4 minutes and 40 seconds, 100 seconds faster than its predecessor, the CR400 Fuxing. During trials, two CR450 trains also set a combined speed record of 896 kph when they passed each other, as reported by Xinhua .

The CR450’s speed is largely due to aerodynamic and structural enhancements over the CR400. The new model features a longer, sleeker nose, a 20-centimeter lower roofline, and a 50-tonne weight reduction, cutting aerodynamic drag by 22%.

Launched in 2021 by China State Railway Group, the CR450 is expected to enter commercial operation in 2026 following its evaluation phase.
