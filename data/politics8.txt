Bui Thi Minh Hoai, who became Hanoi Party secretary mid-term in 2024, has now won the election to remain in the position until 2030.

Her four deputies are Tran Sy Thanh, who is also chairman of the city People's Committee, Nguyen Van Phong, Nguyen Trong Dong, and Phung Thi Hong Ha, according to the first meeting of the 18th Party Committee of Hanoi.

Hoai, 60, holds a master's degree in law. She has been a member of the Party Central Committee since 2011 and a member of the Politburo since 2021.

Hoai started her career as an inspector in the northern province of Nam Dinh before moving on to various inspection and Party administration positions in Ha Nam, which recently merged with Ninh Binh Province near Hanoi.

Then, for 10 years she was vice chairwoman of the Party's Central Inspection Commission.
