Nearly 80 medical students in Ho Chi Minh City have been left in limbo after Pham Ngoc Thach University's joint training program with a German partner was suddenly suspended.

Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine in Ho Chi Minh City on Oct. 21 confirmed that its joint medical training program with Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz of Germany, the only one in Vietnam allowing graduates to practice in Germany, has been suddenly suspended.

The German partner cited changes in national medical exam regulations and new international cooperation policies as the reason for ending the partnership after more than a decade. The decision has shocked students and parents, many of whom have invested years of effort and hundreds of millions of dong in tuition fees.

"Studying in Mainz, and in Germany, was a dream for us," said Thai Chanh Dat, a student from the 2023 cohort. "We've worked hard and proved ourselves in the recent M1 exam."

Launched in 2013, the Vietnam-Germany medical program trained doctors to German standards over 6.3 years, with instruction in Vietnamese, English and German. Students spent five years studying in Vietnam before completing clinical training in Germany, paying around VND115 million (US$4,365) per semester. Graduates received dual medical degrees and a license to practice in Germany.

Pham Ngoc Thach University said the suspension followed a decision by Germany's medical examination authority (IMPP) to stop providing M2 exam materials abroad from 2027, along with funding cuts for joint training programs.

The university has proposed three solutions: negotiating a new program with Mainz, seeking permission to continue offering the M2 exam in Vietnam until 2030, or sending students to Germany for the exam if they reach C1-level German proficiency.

"We're committed to ensuring students can complete their studies," said Associate Professor Nguyen Dang Thoai, the university's acting vice-rector. "If they achieve C1 proficiency, we'll help them apply to medical schools in Germany, not just Mainz."

However, some parents remain unconvinced, calling the proposed solutions "uncertain and impractical."

"At admission, the school guaranteed that students could take the exams in Vietnam. Now everything's unclear," one parent said.

The university insists the cooperation agreement ensures enrolled students can complete the program, though adjustments may be needed for the M2 exam.
