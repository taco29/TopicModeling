The crackdown covered areas including Ang Mo Kio, Balestier, Clementi, Punggol, Woodlands and Yishun. Officers confiscated about 2.5 kilograms of cannabis, 158 grams of ketamine, 76 grams of heroin, 73 grams of methamphetamine or "oce," 12 grams of ecstasy, and 40 Erimin-5 tablets. CNB also seized dozens of vape-related products, including 42 e-vaporizer pods suspected to contain etomidate, a controlled anesthetic substance, Asia One reported.

According to CNB, the seized heroin, ice and cannabis could have fueled the addictions of about 436 abusers for a week.

On Oct. 13, CNB officers arrested a 36-year-old Singaporean man along Yishun Avenue 1 for suspected drug trafficking. A search of his motorcycle uncovered roughly 2.3 kg of cannabis, 156 g of ketamine, 11g of ice, 11g of ecstasy, 40 Erimin-5 tablets and drug paraphernalia, The Straits Times reported.

A follow-up operation led to the arrest of a 27-year-old accomplice in Punggol later that evening, where more paraphernalia were seized.

In a separate raid near Clementi Avenue 1 on Oct. 15, officers arrested a 26-year-old woman for suspected drug trafficking while she was with her 19-month-old daughter. She was found with seven e-vaporizer pods and two e-vaporizers believed to contain etomidate.

A subsequent raid on her home led to the arrest of two more suspects: a 27-year-old man and a 30-year-old woman. The woman resisted arrest and injured two CNB officers and may face extra charges for voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from performing their duty.

Officers seized an additional 27 e-vaporizer pods, one e-vaporizer containing etomidate and various drug paraphernalia.

Under Singapore law, trafficking more than 15 g of pure heroin, 250 g of methamphetamine or 500 g of cannabis carries the mandatory death penalty. Those caught importing, selling or distributing etomidate-laced e-vaporizers also face prosecution under the Misuse of Drugs Act.
