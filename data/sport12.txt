Lionel Messi will enjoy special financial benefits after signing a three-year contract extension with MLS club Inter Miami until 2028.

Messi's previous contract was set to expire at the end of the 2025 MLS season. This new agreement, which could be the final contract of his career as a footballer, not only extends his playing time but also includes several attractive benefits outside of the pitch.

According to beIN SPORTS , the deal grants Messi the right to buy shares in the club in the future and maintains his lucrative partnerships with Adidas and Apple. It also solidifies his role as a global brand ambassador for Inter Miami.

This is seen as a long-term strategic agreement, positioning Messi not just as a player, but as the face of the project led by English football legend David Beckham and the club's leadership.

While Messi's salary under the new extension was not disclosed, American media believe it will remain consistent with his earnings over the past two years at Miami.

According to the MLS Players Association, Messi's current contract includes a base salary of US$12 million per year, with total guaranteed income reaching $20.4 million. This figure places him about $5 million ahead of the league's second-highest-paid player, Lorenzo Insigne of Toronto FC.

This extension builds on an already massive deal. Sportico previously reported that the total value of Messi's initial 2.5-year contract at Inter Miami was up to $150 million, which included advertising contracts and brand ambassador roles.

According to Forbes , in 2024 alone, Messi earned an additional $79 million from advertising contracts with partners like Adidas, Hard Rock International and Apple TV. His deal with Apple notably includes a percentage of revenue from the MLS broadcasting package, valued at $250 million per year.

Messi has repeatedly told the press that he is very satisfied with life in the U.S. Inter Miami, in turn, has been eager to keep him for longer, citing both his professional contributions and the immense commercial value he brings to the club.
