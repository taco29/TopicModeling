Manuela Nicolosi, the referee who has officiated more than 200 professional football matches, revealed that players tried to flirt with her and she was refused promotion because of her appearance.

Nicolosi, 45, is recognized as one of the trailblazers for women pursuing careers in refereeing. Her career includes appearances at the 2016 and 2020 Olympics.

She became the first Italian referee to officiate the Women's World Cup final in 2019, also the year she served as an assistant referee in the UEFA Super Cup between Liverpool and Chelsea, a landmark event for women officiating major men's football tournaments.

However, Nicolosi's achievements came alongside challenges. She told Quotidiano Sportivo that her appearance, rather than helping her career, became an obstacle.

"All my superiors told me: you have to be less visible, you attract too much attention," she said.

"In France, one year I did not move up from Serie C to Serie B because I was too visible. I was about to give up. Technical errors or failed athletic tests are one thing. But to be held back by being told 'you're flashy' is a big problem," she said.

She left Italy at age 20 after realizing that the domestic football environment was not supportive of women.

"They let you reach a certain level, the regional level, and then they put obstacles in your way in every sense," she added.

Nicolosi emphasized that violence and verbal abuse are challenges for all referees, but women face additional pressure, including unwanted attention from players. She confirmed that she has been flirted with and harassed, but has never given in.

"I prefer not to talk about it. I never gave in, that's why it took me so long to forge a career," she said. "I'm not one of those who dream of getting involved with a footballer."

Nicolosi recently officiated in the Kings League, a seven-a-side football tournament founded by former Spanish football star Gerard Pique in 2022, featuring former players and social media stars, according to Marca .

With dual Italian and French citizenship, Nicolosi continues her refereeing career with dedication. On Instagram, where she has nearly 200,000 followers, she shares match photos alongside messages promoting gender equality in sports.
