South Korea attracted more than 305,000 international students as of August, surpassing its 2027 target, with Vietnamese students leading the influx.

This is the first time the number of international students enrolled in South Korean universities and language schools has exceeded 300,000, allowing the country to reach its ambitious target two years ahead of schedule, according to data from the Korea Immigration Service, cited by the Korea JoongAng Daily.

Of the 305,329 international students, 225,769 were enrolled in university programs, 79,500 were learning Korean, and the rest attended other language courses.

The total represents a 16% increase from last year and a 47% rise since mid-2023. Vietnamese students numbered 107,807, followed by 86,179 from China, with Uzbekistan, Mongolia, and Nepal rounding out the top five sources.

Government policies including expanded scholarships, relaxed work rules, and longer post-study employment opportunities have boosted South Korea's appeal to foreign students, according to ICEF Monitor .

Part-time work allowances were increased in 2023, allowing language and undergraduate students to work up to 25 hours per week and master's and doctoral students up to 35 hours, with unlimited weekend and public holiday hours. Financial requirements were lowered from 26 million won (US$18,200) to 20 million won, or 16 million won for schools outside Seoul.

Post-graduation work stays were extended to three years from six months, with the option to extend two more years, while the government plans to broaden industries open to foreign workers and lengthen residence periods.

Scholarship programs were expanded under the Global Korea Scholarship, offering 2,700 awards for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students and 6,000 for other disciplines, with STEM graduates given priority for permanent residency. The minimum residence period for permanent residency was shortened from six years to three.

Universities are recognizing more Korean language tests and may lower TOPIK requirements, although experts caution this could affect academic performance.
