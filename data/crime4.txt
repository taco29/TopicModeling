Hiroshima Prefecture police detained Dinh Thi Phuong, 32, a Vietnamese technical intern living in Hiroshima City, on suspicion of trespassing, robbery, and murder, police announced on Saturday. It is unclear whether the suspect has admitted to the charges, Fuji News Network reported.

Phuong is accused of attacking Nguyen Thuy Nga, 32, at the victim’s apartment in Nishi Ward, Hiroshima City, on Oct. 15. Police said she allegedly entered Nga’s apartment with the intent to steal valuables. She is suspected of repeatedly striking Nga on the head and face with a hard object, killing her, and then ransacking the room.

The victim suffered multiple head injuries causing bleeding, along with other injuries across her body. She died of hemorrhagic shock due to skull fractures, Asahi cited the police.

Later that afternoon, Nga's husband, also a Vietnamese expat, returned home from work to find her lying in a pool of blood and immediately reported the incident to the police. Investigators confirmed her death and discovered numerous bloody footprints near the entrance.

The couple lived on the 14th floor of an apartment building near a subway station.

Police launched a manhunt and announced Phuong's arrest on Oct. 25. They are investigating the relationship between the two women and exploring other possible motives for the crime.

The technical intern program in Japan is a government-to-government initiative that allows foreigners from developing countries to work in Japan for up to five years in order to acquire skills and knowledge.
