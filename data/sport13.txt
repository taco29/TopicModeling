Jude Bellingham posted a message on social media in response to Lamine Yamal after scoring in Real Madrid's 2-1 victory over Barcelona in the El Clásico on Sunday night.

The match at Santiago Bernabeu featured significant tension, with several Real Madrid players confronting 18-year-old Yamal after the game regarding his provocative pre-match comments. Dani Carvajal and Thibaut Courtois were seen reprimanding the young forward, with the situation escalating when Vinicius Jr. became involved, forcing teammates to separate the players.

Spanish newspaper AS reported that Yamal allegedly challenged Vinicius to a private confrontation, further angering the Brazilian star.

Bellingham avoided the scuffle but posted a brief message on Instagram and accompanied it with photos from the match.

"Talk is cheap. HALA MADRID SIEMPRE!!!" he wrote.

Last week, when asked on the channel of former Barca star Gerard Pique‘s seven-a-side Kings League if Real Madrid resembled one of the teams in the competition, Yamal took the chance to mock his rivals.

"Yes, they rob, they complain, they do things..." Yamal said, as quoted by The Sun .

Madrid supporters also clapped back at Yamal. Veteran commentator Tomas Roncero sarcastically thanked Yamal during a live broadcast of Cadena SER , suggesting the young star's words provided extra motivation for Real Madrid players.

"Yamal, an 18-year-old boy, unable to control himself, made a slip of the tongue," Roncero wrote. "But I have to thank him, because he was the one who added fuel to the fire at Bernabeu from the first minute."

Amid the controversy, Yamal's father, Mounir Nasraoui, defended his son online, posting a photo of Yamal with the caption: "You're only 18 my son. See you in Barcelona," later adding, "Until death do us part," to show his support.

On the pitch, Bellingham had a stellar performance. He assisted Kylian Mbappé's opening goal in the 22nd minute before scoring the winner himself. At 22 years and 119 days old, Bellingham became the youngest Real Madrid player in the 21st century to both score and assist against Barcelona in any competition, surpassing teammate Vinicius (22 years, 267 days) in the Copa del Rey match in April 2023.

In contrast, Yamal had a quiet evening, playing the full 90 minutes but registering only four successful dribbles from eight attempts and losing possession 22 times.
