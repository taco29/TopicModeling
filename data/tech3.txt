A Li Mega electric MPV caught fire while traveling on a road in Shanghai’s Xuhui District, China, completely burning down though both occupants escaped safely.

The fire occurred late on Oct. 23. Sparks were first seen coming from the car’s chassis at a traffic light, and within seconds, flames spread across the vehicle, according to CNEvpost , citing Chinese media outlet The Paper . Both the driver and passenger managed to open the doors and exit safely before the fire engulfed the vehicle. Videos and photos circulating online show the car reduced to a metal frame.

Car News China reported that there was no collision before the fire broke out. The battery pack, located within the chassis, is suspected to have been the ignition source. Li Auto has launched a joint investigation with local fire authorities to determine the cause.

This is the second high-profile EV fire in China this month. On Oct. 13, a Xiaomi SU7 sedan caught fire after a severe collision in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, resulting in the driver’s death after the doors failed to open.

Two other Li Mega minivans caught fire in China since June, both attributed to external causes. The latest case has raised concern as no definitive cause has been identified.

Launched in March 2024, the Li Mega marked Li Auto’s first fully electric vehicle, expanding beyond its popular range-extended hybrids. The large MPV uses CATL’s Qilin ternary NMC battery and supports 5C ultra-fast charging, allowing it to recover substantial range within minutes, as reported by Interesting Engineering .

Since its debut, Li Auto has sold 25,817 units of the Mega, with September 2025 seeing its highest monthly deliveries at 3,277 units across China.
