Rainfall in the central city of Hue reached 1,085.8 mm in 24 hours until 11 p.m. Monday, marking the highest volume of rainfall ever recorded in Vietnam, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.
The water level of the Bo River at the Phu Oc Station in Hue reached 5.25 meters on Monday afternoon, exceeding the historical level recorded in 2020. The level on the Huong River peaked at 5.05 meters on Monday night and dropped to 4.76 meters early on Tuesday morning, still 1.24 meters beyond the third warning level, the highest.

Mai Van Khiem, Director of the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, explained that this unprecedented rainfall resulted from a combination of factors: low-level cold air, a tropical convergence zone shifting northwards, and strong, moist easterly winds at altitudes of 1,500–5,000 meters. This typical weather pattern in central Vietnam often leads to prolonged heavy rains.

Khiem warned that heavy rains would persist. From Monday evening through late Wednesday, heavy to very heavy rainfall is forecast for areas from southern Quang Tri to Da Nang, bordering Hue to the north and south; and the eastern part of Quang Ngai which is south of Da Nang, with expected totals ranging from 200–400 mm, and locally reaching up to 700–800 mm.

Provinces from Ha Tinh to northern Quang Tri, north of Hue, are likely to receive 100–200 mm, with some areas experiencing more than 350 mm of rain during this period.

By Wednesday night into Thursday, rainfall is expected to gradually decrease in the south-central region (Da Nang, Quang Ngai) and shift towards the northern central region.

Khiem indicated that the heavy rains in central Vietnam are likely to persist for the coming days, increasing the risk of flooding, flash floods, and landslides.

The downpours, which began to intensify on Oct. 25, have caused widespread flooding in Hue and Hoi An, which is part of Da Nang.

According to Vietnam News Agency, continuous downpours have severely affected several central provinces. In Hue, major streets were submerged. Local authorities have warned of prolonged flooding in downstream areas, flash floods, and landslides in mountainous communes.

In Quang Ngai Province, heavy rain on Oct. 25–26 triggered multiple landslides, isolating several communities. Over 70 households were relocated from high-risk zones, while transport routes such as National Highway 24C remain impassable.

In Kon Tum Province’s Dak Plo Commune, torrential rain caused serious landslides, damaging homes, roads, and crops. Nearly 450 households were temporarily cut off, and local authorities have mobilized heavy machinery to restore access once conditions allow.
