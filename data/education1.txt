Vietnam will make English a mandatory subject from grade 1 under a nationwide plan to establish it as a second language in schools by 2030.

The move is part of the government's newly approved project to make English a second language in schools for the 2025–2035 period, with vision to 2045, announced on Oct. 29.

Under the plan, all schools nationwide must teach English as a compulsory subject from grade 1. By 2030, at least 20% of schools are expected to meet level-1 teaching standards, 5% to reach level 2, and 2% to reach level 3. In the following years, the share of level 3 schools will gradually increase to 15%, level 2 to 20%, and level 1 to 50%.

The ministry said the three teaching levels will be assessed based on several factors, including the language environment, teaching programs, learning materials, digital transformation, AI application, teacher quality and international cooperation.

An education official added that the evaluation may also consider how often English is used in classes, signage and school websites.

Currently, English is mandatory from grade 3. Some schools with enough qualified teachers and facilities can offer it from grade 1, but only as an elective with two lessons per week.

At the preschool level, under the new initiative, all kindergartens must introduce children to English within the next five years, with at least 10% reaching level 1. By 2045, the proportions of level 1, 2 and 3 schools are targeted at 50%, 20% and 10%, respectively.

For universities, 50% of institutions are expected to reach level 2 and 35% to reach level 3 by the end of the plan.

The project aims to improve English proficiency, build a foreign-language ecosystem in schools and help shape a globally competent generation ready for international integration. Key solutions include raising public awareness, training more English teachers, modernizing teaching and assessment methods, using AI and advanced technology in classrooms and boosting global partnerships.

The Politburo last year also urged greater foreign-language education, calling English a potential second language for schools nationwide.

By 2035, the Ministry of Education and Training expects all students to learn English as a second language. To achieve this, Vietnam will need 12,000 more preschool English teachers, 10,000 at the primary level, and at least 200,000 teachers capable of teaching in English by 2030.
