Nguyen Van Nam, of Co Dam Commune, faces investigation on a charge of "intentional infliction of injury."

According to authorities, he bandaged her wound and went to sleep before leaving for work the next morning, locking the girl inside the house.

Relatives heard the child crying through a window and took her to Vinh City General Hospital. She sustained multiple injuries and required seven stitches to her head. Her condition has stabilized and relatives are completing discharge procedures, officials said.

Nam was arrested on Oct. 19 evening while hiding on the roof of his mother's house nearby. During questioning, he reportedly said he "lost control in a moment of anger" and expressed regret.

Local authorities told police Nam had previously abused the girl on multiple occasions and received a warning last year.

The victim's mother, 29-year-old Ban Thi Binh, married Nam in 2022. Binh and Nam have two children together and are renting a home in Ha Tinh.

The girl has said she fears further abuse and hopes to return to northern Vietnam to live with her grandmother. Prosecutors and police continue to investigate the case.
