In a Facebook post on Tuesday, the LTA addressed the viral trend, acknowledging the desire for viral moments but stressing that public infrastructure must be respected and preserved for its intended purpose: ensuring safe travel, The Straits Times reported.

"Fun’s fun, but our road infrastructure isn’t a playground," the LTA stated. "It helps facilitate travel and keeps everyone safe. Please don’t use them as props for social media. Let’s keep our roads safe ."

The warning was accompanied by a video featuring AI-generated images of people performing the stunt.

The trend emerged on TikTok, where participants film themselves hanging from street signs while lip-syncing to the chorus of the song "Maui Wowie" by Kid Cudi, according to Mothership .

"Maui Wowie" refers to a Hawaiian cannabis strain and gained further attention when TikTok user @aaronxbrownn filmed himself hanging from a street sign in Honolulu.

The video has since gained over 750,000 likes and millions of views, prompting others to replicate the stunt and further fuel the trend.
