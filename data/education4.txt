The British International School (BIS) Hanoi recently welcomed hundreds of families, students, and staff to its campus for the International Festival 2025, the school's largest annual celebration of global culture and community spirit.

With over 70 booths showcasing diverse cultures, student projects, student-led initiatives, community service partners, and live performances, the festival transformed the campus into a vibrant display of diversity, inclusion, and creativity.

BIS Hanoi parents took a leading role this year, turning the campus into a lively cultural showcase. Booths representing Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brazil, and Spain offered visitors a rich cultural experience with artifacts, traditional food, clothing, and stories from each nation.

This year's community street saw an increase in the number of community partners who shared their initiatives and invited families to get involved. Organizations presented projects, raised awareness, and sold products supporting important causes. Alongside them, the school's student groups showcased their Creativity, Activity, and Service (CAS) projects.

CAS is one of the three essential components of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme at BIS Hanoi. It encourages students to engage in a wide range of activities beyond their academic studies, fostering new challenges and collaborative problem-solving. This year, the students' booths highlighted their efforts to create positive change, contributing to the festival's sense of purpose and community spirit.

A new addition this year was the Stamp Rally. Students collected stamps by visiting cultural and CAS student booths, and then spun the Fortune Wheel for fun prizes. The activity quickly became a favorite, encouraging exploration, cultural exchange, and a sense of adventure.

Throughout the day, students from various year groups took to the stage with a dynamic lineup of music and dance performances curated by the Performing Arts Team.

Primary students kicked off the performances with "Fanga Alafia", a traditional West African song and dance that set a joyful tone.

The Primary K-pop CCA impressed with "Rebel Heart", while the Year 10 dance group brought Brazilian carnival energy with "A Linha Curva". The Senior Choir closed the performances with a powerful rendition of "Tarekita" from India.

Audiences also enjoyed a preview of this year's secondary production, West Side Story, with the cast performing "America." Each performance reflected the hard work, creativity, and confidence of the students, celebrating diverse cultures through music and dance.

Families were treated to a culinary journey through nearly 20 food stalls, offering flavors from around the world. Shopping and activity booths added to the lively atmosphere with crafts, unique merchandise, and hands-on experiences. The game zone, managed by BIS Hanoi teachers, provided fun for all ages, filling the air with laughter and friendly competition. These spaces created a warm environment for families to explore, connect, and share stories.

The International Festival 2025 was a celebration of the unique character of the BIS Hanoi community, which has been a cornerstone of the school since its establishment in 2012. As part of Nord Anglia Education, BIS Hanoi students and families are connected to a global network of over 90 international schools across 35 countries.
