The security guard noticed a group of passengers allowing children to run back and forth in the carriage when the metro train stopped at Thu Duc Station at around 5 p.m., and reminded them to keep order. A conflict quickly escalated.

Videos recorded by passengers show the guard being repeatedly punched and kicked in the head by one teenager from the group, even after he had sat down on the floor. Another teenager then rushed in and kicked him, while several passengers attempted to intervene.

A representative of the HCMC Urban Railway Company No. 1 (HURC1), the subway operator, said the guard suffered multiple injuries. The company is coordinating with police to handle the case.

Police are collecting additional evidence to pursue legal action. No further details about the identities of the teenage boys have been revealed.

The Ben Thanh – Suoi Tien metro line, nearly 20 km long with 14 stations, connects HCMC center to the eastern gateway and began operating at the end of last year. According to a June report from HURC1, the line serves an average of 57,785 passengers per day.
