According to authorities, both boys, aged 14 and attending ninth grade in Noi Bai Commune, were involved in an altercation that escalated over a series of insults and challenges.

On Oct. 25, the victim initially invited the other boy to hang out, but the latter declined, so the victim called and insulted him on the phone.

The other boy then texted the victim to challeng him to a fight, where he stabbed him with a knife as they two met at around 8:10 p.m., as reported by the People's Police newspaper.

The victim was rushed to hospital by local residents but succumbed to his injuries, according to Voice of Vietnam .

Following the attack, the suspect hid the knife in his motorbike’s storage compartment and rode home, despite it being illegal for a 14-year-old to operate a motorbike in Vietnam.

At 10:30 p.m., police arrested the suspect and brought him in for questioning.
